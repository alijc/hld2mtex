<h1>Format of a .hld file</h1>

The process all starts out with a text source file.
By convention it has an extension of `.hld'.

<p>
Here's a short extract from a .hld file to use as an example:

<pre>
T:O quam mirabilis
C:Hildegard von Bingen
B:Reisenkodex
X:+3

O       .=C .=D l=E l=F .=E .=D .=C b@B .=A .=B l=C
quam    n=DC
mi-     /=EF
mi-	/=EF
ra-	l=D
bi-	l=C
lis	.=B
est	n=DC
+L
</pre>

<p>
It has two parts: the header, which gives general information
about the song, and the body, which lays out all of the words,
notes and neumes.  (Blank lines can be added anywhere - they
will be ignored.)

<h2>The Header</h2>

Each line of the header starts with a capital letter, followed
by a `:', followed by some text.  (If you guessed that I 
borrowed this format from abc format, you get two points.)

<p>
<table border=2 cellpadding=3>
<tr><th>Letter</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Example</th>
<tr><td>T:</td><td>Title</td><td>T:O magne Pater</td>
<tr><td>C:</td><td>Composer</td><td>C:Hildegard von Bingen</td>
<tr><td>B:</td><td>Book</td><td>B:Reisenkodex</td>
<tr><td colspan="3"> Optional Header Lines</td>
<tr><td>X:</td><td>Transposition (number of half-steps)</td><td>X:-3</th>
<tr><td>O:</td><td>Whether to use an octave clef</td><td>O:1</th>
<tr><td>Q:</td><td>Whether to show the optional notes of a quilisma</td><td>Q:0</th>
</table>

<h2>The Body</h2>

The body of the file is made up of note lines and spacing lines.

<h3>Note Lines</h3>

A note line consists of a single syllable, followed by one or
more neume-note groups.

<p>
The syllable will be be printed on the lyrics line, under
the first of its notes.

<p>
Each neume-note group consists of one or more neume keys
(see <a href="./neume-font.html">previous section</a>), 
followed by one or more notes.

<p>
The notes are the same as in abc format.  `A' is the A
below middle C, `B' through `G' are in the octave above
it, and `a' through `g' represent the next octave.
If you have to go higher than that then use a lower
case letter and stick an apostaphe after it (a').
If you need to go lower, then stick a comma after a
upper case letter (G,).

<p>
For example, "<samp>nos	.=e w=eg l=a'</samp>"
would represent the syllable "nos" sung on a
punctum on e, a quilisma on e to g, and a virga
on a.

<h4>Accidentals</h4>

You can add a flat sign into the score by inserting
"<samp>b@b</samp>" into the proper place in the list
of neume-note groups.  (The first `b' asks for a flat,
while the second asks for it to be placed on the b
above middle c.) 

<p>
You can add an editorial flat by inserting a `_'
before the note that needs to be flatted.  For example,
"<samp>Wn=G_ba</samp>".

<h3>Spacing Lines</h3>

<p>
A spacing line consists of a `+', followed by one or more
characters, whose meaning is as follows:
<table border=2 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td>b </td><td> a bar 
<tr><td>l </td><td> a new line 
<tr><td>L </td><td> a bar & a new line
<tr><td>s </td><td> a little bit of extra horizontal space
<tr><td>H </td><td> a chunk of horizontal space
<tr><td>V </td><td> a chunk of vertical space
