<h1>Transcriptions of Hildegard's Music</h1>

I got tired of transcribing Hildegard's music by hand,
so I started looking around for software to help.
Unfortunately (and not surprisingly), I couldn't find
any existing music notation packages that could handle
12th century liturgical notation. So I decided to 
make one myself.  And in the spirit of open source
software, I hereby present it to anyone who might 
want to use it (or to improve upon it). 

<p>
The entire package is actually made up of a number
of different pieces, of which I only created two
small bits.  The pieces that I wrote are <i>hld2mtex</i>,
a script for converting a source file into musixtex format, and
<i>neumes.mf</i>, which defines a font to use for 
Hildegard's neumes.  The other packages that you need
are <i>TeX</i>, <i>MusiXTeX</i>, and  <i>Perl</i>.
All of these packages are platform-independent, and so
should run on any computer.

<p>
Here are more detailed descriptions that should explain
everything completely:
