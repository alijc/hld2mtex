<h1>Downloading and Installing</h1>

If you don't already have them, you need to get 
<i>TeX</i>, <i>MusiXTeX</i>, and  <i>Perl</i>.
You can get them off of a CD, from your favorite
download site, or, if all else fails, go to the websites at
<a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/TeX.html">http://www.math.upenn.edu/TeX.html</a>,
<a href="http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html">http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html</a>,
and <a href="http://www.perl.com">http://www.perl.com</a>.
Install these, following the instructions for your platform.

<p>
Then get <a href="./source/neumes.mf">neumes.mf</a> and
<a href="./source/hld2mtex">hld2mtex</a> from here.  
You'll need to put `hld2mtex' into a directory that's 
in your path, and you may need to make it executable.
You should put `neumes.mf' into the tex directory 
structure, perhaps into the same directory where the
musix mf files are.  Then you may need to run a command
called `mktexlsr' to let tex know where everything is.

<p>
(The current font tries to look like it was written with a quill.
An older one used a ballpoint pen.  It you'd prefer that one you
can still find it <a href="./source/neumes-round.mf">here</a>.

<p>
To test things out, download <a href="./examples/alleluia.hld">
alleluia.hld</a> from the 
<a href="./transcripts.html">previous page</a>, and type:

<pre>
hld2mtex alleluia.hld
tex alleluia.tex
dvips alleluia.dvi
</pre>

If all goes well, you'll end up with a page of music on your
printer.


<p>
If you'd like to grab all of the bits and pieces that I've
made in one fell swoop, you can get either a <a href="../hld2mtex.zip">zipped
</a> or <a href="../hld2mtex.tar.gz">tarred</a> file.  This includes the
neumes.mf font and the hld2mtex script, along with these html pages
and the transcriptions that I've done thus far.
